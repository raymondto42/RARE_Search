RARE_Search is a tool which takes in very specific files. The sequence files used MUST be limited to:
  A) A header with +++ for sequences on the coding strand and --- for sequences on the non-coding strand
  B) The sequences must only include the 20k bp upstream of a gene's transcription start site, the gene sequence, and the 20k bp 
  downstream of the gene

This tool will then search those sequences and return any RARE sequences found (or their reverse compliments), along with where those 
sequences are relative to upstream or downstream of the transcription start site or end site. 
The sequences search 20k instead of 10k due to the fact that multiple species came back with similar RARE sites in the high 10k range. 
This search is limited to 10k in the RARE_Xenopus program.

RARE_Xenopus is slightly more versitile, and could likely be easily configured to search other species for RARE sites. The program takes
in the Xenbase J-strain v9.2 genome and gene model. Using the gene model, it searches within the 10kb upstream and downstream of the TSS
and end sites. It then outputs a text file (which can be easily transfered into excel for data manipulation) that has each gene with RARE
sites. The genes have both the sites and the chromosome coordinates for those sites on the same line.
